<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/i005b.jpg" style="margin-top: -1em;" alt="T" /></span><i>here would be little Occasion for a Preface to this Treatise, if the
last Foreign Advices had not given us something particular relating to the
Pestilence that now rages in the South Parts of</i> France; <i>and what may
more particularly recommend these Relations to the World, is, because they
come from Physicians, who resided at the Infected Places.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>The Physician at <i>Aix</i> gives us the following Account.</p>

<p><i>The Contagious Distemper, which has become the Reproach of our Faculty
here for above a Month past, is more violent than that at</i> Marseilles; <i>it
breaks out in Carbuncles, Buboes, livid Blisters, and purple Spots; the
first Symptoms are grievous Pains in the Head, Consternations, wild Looks,
a trembling Voice, a cadaverous Face, a Coldness in all the extreme Parts,
a low unequal Pulse, great Pains in the Stomach, Reachings to Vomit, and
these are follow&#8217;d by Sleepiness, Deliriums, Convulsions, or Fluxes of
Blood, the Forerunners of sudden Death. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> the Bodies that are open&#8217;d,
we find gangrenous Inflammations in all the lower Parts of the Belly,
Breast and Neck. Above fifty Persons have died every Day for three Weeks
past in the Town and Hospitals. Most of them fall into a dreadful Phrenzy,
so that we are forc&#8217;d to tie them.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>The other is a Letter from a Physician at</i> Marseilles, <i>sent to</i> John
Wheake, <i>Esq; who was so kind to give me the Abstract.</i></p>

<p class="right">Marseilles <i>Sept.</i> 15. 1720.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I Arriv&#8217;d here the 8<i>th</i>, and enter&#8217;d the Gate of <i>Aix</i> which leads to the
<i>Cours</i>, which has always been esteem&#8217;d one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> most pleasant
Prospects in the Kingdom, but that Day was a very dismal Spectacle to me;
all that great Place, both on the Right and Left, was fill&#8217;d with Dead,
Sick, and Dying Persons. The Carts were continually employ&#8217;d in going and
returning to carry away the Dead Carcasses, of which there were that Day
above four Thousand. The Town was without Bread, without Wine, without
Meat, without Medicines, and in general, without any Succours.</p>

<p>The Father abandon&#8217;d the Child, and the Son the Father; the Husband the
Wife, and the Wife the Husband; and those who had not a House to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>themselves, lay upon Quilts in the Streets and the Pavements; all the
Streets were fill&#8217;d with Cloaths and Houshold-Goods, strew&#8217;d with Dead
Dogs and Cats, which made an insupportable Stench. Meat was Sold at 18 to
20 <i>Sous per</i> Pound, and was only distributed to those that had Billets
from the Consuls: This, Sir, was the miserable State of this City at that
Time, but at present, Things have a better appearance; Monsieur <i>le
Marquis de Langeron</i>, who Commands here, has caused the Dead to be Buried,
the Cloaths and Goods to be burnt, and the Shops to be open&#8217;d, for the
Sustenance of the Publick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>Two Hospitals are prepar&#8217;d where they carry all the Sick of the Town, good
Orders are daily re-establish&#8217;d, and the Obligation is chiefly owing to
Monsieur <i>de Langeron</i>, who does Wonders. However, there is not any Divine
Service Celebrated, nor are there any Confessors. The People die, and are
buried without any Ceremonies of the Church; But the Bishop, with an
undaunted Courage, goes thro&#8217; the Streets, and into Publick Places,
accompanied with a Jesuit and one Ecclesiastick, to Exhort the Dying, and
to give them Absolution; and he distributes his Charity very largely. The
Religious Order have almost all perish&#8217;d, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> the Fathers of the Oratory
are not exempt; it is accounted, that there have died 50000 Persons. One
thing very particular is, that Monsieur <i>Moustier</i>, one of the Consuls of
the City, who has been continually on Horseback ordering the Slaves who
carried away the Dead in Carts, or those that were Sick, to the Hospitals,
enjoys his Health as well as he did the first Day he began; the Sickness
seems at present to abate, and we have the Satisfaction to see several
whom we took under our Care at the Beginning of the Sickness, promise fair
towards a Recovery. The Sickness however, is of a very extraordinary
Nature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> the Observations we have in our Authors, have scarce any
Agreement with what we find in this: It is the Assistance of Heaven we
ought to implore, and to wait for a Blessing from thence upon our Labours.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">I am, <i>&amp;c.</i></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>We may observe, that the Contagion now spreading it self in Foreign
Parts, has nearly the same Symptoms that were observ&#8217;d in the late Plague
at</i> London; <i>so that what Medicines were then used with good Success, may
direct not only the People of</i> England <i>in the way of Practice, if</i> God
<i>Almighty should please to afflict us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> with that dreadful Distemper, but
be serviceable likewise to the Infected Places abroad. There is room
enough to hope, the approaching Cold, which we naturally expect at this
Season, may prevent its spreading amongst us for some Months, &#8217;till the
Air begins to warm, but the Seeds of that Venom may be brought over in
Merchandizes even in the coldest Months, and according to the Nature of
Insects will not hatch, or appear to our Prejudice, &#8217;till the hotter
Seasons. For to suppose this Malignant Distemper is occasion&#8217;d by Vapours
only arising from the Earth, is to lay aside our Reason, as I think I have
already shewn in my</i> New Improvements of Planting, <i>&amp;c. to which my Reader
may refer.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span><i>I suppose there may be such Persons in the World who do not agree with
the Hypothesis I have laid down in the following Sheets, altho&#8217; many
Learned Authors have supported it; and again, I expect others to Except
against the Concise way I have taken, in writing upon a Subject, which at
this time ought to be set in the plainest Light; but as I found the Danger
of Pestilence spreading it self more and more every Day, a true Lover of
his Country could not be easie without giving the Publick some Hints to
prevent its dismal Effects, and at the same time to engage the Learned to
write upon such an Occasion.</i></p>

<p><i>And it is with Pleasure I observe, that since the former Editions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> of
this small Tract has been made publick, our Learned Physicians are
dispos&#8217;d to consider the necessary Means to prevent (as far as in them
lies) the spreading of this Calamity, and justly deserve the favour of the
Publick.</i></p>

<p><i>For my own part, I can only say, that the short time I had to put this
Work together, would not allow me to give it with that exactness, that I
would have done, if I could have had more Leisure.</i></p>

<h3>THE</h3>
<h1>PLAGUE</h1>
<h3>AT</h3>
<h2><i>MARSEILLES</i></h2>
<h2>CONSIDER&#8217;D, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/i003b.jpg" style="margin-top: -1em;" alt="T" /></span>he Deplorable Condition of the <i>Marseillians</i>, and the Danger that all
the Trading Parts of <i>Europe</i> are now in, of being Infected by the Plague
which rages in the <i>South</i> Parts of <i>France</i>, and every Day spreads it
self more and more over the Neighbouring Countries, gives me occasion to
Publish some Papers which would never have otherwise appeared in the
World.</p>

<p>When I consider the melancholy Circumstances of the People at <i>Marseilles</i>
and other infected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Places, how they are now divested of Relief, and
brought into that miserable State, that even every Man is terrified at the
Approach of his dearest Friend, and the very Aspect of our Neighbours
strike such Horror and Confusion in us, as if they brought our Death and
Destruction with them; it is then surely time for every one to contribute
all that in him lies to prevent the Progress of so <i>direful a Calamity</i>.</p>

<p>The good Counsels of our Nation, therefore, to prevent as much as possible
the Infection which might be brought among us by Merchandizes coming from
Infected Places, have wisely order&#8217;d strict Quarentine to be perform&#8217;d,
before either the Sailors or Goods can be brought ashoar.</p>

<p>The Neighbouring Nations of Trade, have follow&#8217;d our Example, but the
<i>Hollanders</i> in an extraordinary manner, have even order&#8217;d the Burning the
very Ships and Goods coming from <i>Marseilles</i>, and have been so cautious,
as to suffer none of the Passengers to come on Shoar, without first being
dis-rob&#8217;d of all their Apparel, and even to be well wash&#8217;d with Sea Water,
and then likewise to perform Quarentine in a little Island, remote from
the Inhabitants. I could mention many Relations we have had, of the
Sufferings of the poor People belonging to <i>Marseilles</i>, who to avoid the
dismal Consequence of the Plague, have flown for Refuge into the Country,
and have either been starv&#8217;d to Death, or Murder&#8217;d by the Country People;
but yet we find, that notwithstanding all these Precautions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> that
Pestilence continues to destroy as much as ever, and makes it Advances
every Day more towards us.</p>

<p>It is computed, that about 60000 are Dead of the Plague at <i>Marseilles</i>;
and that there are now (<i>October</i> 20. <i>N. S.</i>) above 14000, Persons left
in that Town, including 10000 Sick; and at <i>Aubagne</i>, out of 10000 who
retir&#8217;d thither from <i>Marseilles</i>, above 9000 are Dead.</p>

<p>On this sad Occasion of the Ruin of <i>Marseilles</i> especially since there is
talk of Burning that Town, it may not be unseasonable to give an Account
of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8216;<i>Marseilles</i> is one of the most considerable Cities in <i>France</i>, and
the most Populous and most trading Town of all <i>Provance</i>. It is so
Antient, that it is reckon&#8217;d to have been Built upwards of Six
Hundred and Thirty Years before the Birth of our Saviour. It was once
a very flourishing Republick; and its University was in such Esteem,
as drew Students thither from all Parts of <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Marseilles</i> is situate at the Foot of a Hill, which rises in the
Form of an Amphitheatre in proportion to its Distance from the Sea.
The Harbour is Oval, and bounded by a Key about fourteen hundred
Paces long, upon which stand the handsomest Houses in the Town. It
affords a very delightful Walk, Part whereof is taken up in the Day
time by the working Gally-Slaves Stalls, where you may furnish your
self with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> Cloaths and other Necessaries; the Entrance of the Harbour
is shut up by a Chain supported at certain Distances by three
Stone-Pillars; so that only one large Ship can pass at a time, tho&#8217;
the Haven will contain about Five hundred. And hither are brought all
sorts of Commodities from all Parts of the known World.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Cathedral Church, call&#8217;d <i>Notre Dame la Majeure</i>, whereof S.
<i>Lazarus</i> is Patron, is very Solemn. It was formerly a Temple
dedicated to <i>Venus</i>, or to <i>Diana</i> of <i>Ephesus</i>. Its Form is
Irregular; but it was not thought proper to add or diminish any
thing. There remain several large Columns, on which stood the Idol.
The Treasure of this Church is very Rich. Here you see the Head of S.
<i>Lazarus</i>, that of S. <i>Connat</i>, a Foot of S. <i>Victor</i>, and many other
Relicks. Near the Cathedral, is a Chappel built upon the Spot where
(the <i>Marseillians</i> tell you) S. <i>Mary Magdalen</i> preached the Gospel
to the Idolaters, as they came out of the Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Notre Dame des Acoules</i> is also a fine large Church, which was
formerly a Temple sacred to the Goddess <i>Pallas</i>. In that of S.
<i>Martin</i>, which is Collegiate and Parochial, is preserv&#8217;d a Silver
Image of the blessed Virgin, five Foot and half high, the Crown and
Ornaments whereof are very rich. The Church of S. <i>Saviour</i>, now
belonging to a Nunnery, was anciently a Temple of <i>Apollo</i>. All these
Places are so many Proofs of the Antiquity of <i>Marseilles</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> as well
as two other Temples near the Port, with two Towers, <i>viz.</i> that of
S. <i>John</i>, which is a Commandry of the Knights of <i>Malta</i>, and that
of S. <i>Nicolas</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Abby of S. <i>Victor</i>, of the Order of S. <i>Benedict</i>, is situate
at the Foot of the Citadel. It resembles a Castle, being encompass&#8217;d
with Walls, and set off with Towers. At the Front of the Church are
these Words address&#8217;d to S. <i>Victor</i>,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Massiliam ver&egrave; Victor civesque tuere.</i></p>

<p>&#8216;In a Chappel on one side of the Epistle, you see the Head of that
Saint, in a Shrine of Silver guilt, finely wrought, which was given
by Pope <i>Urban</i> V. whose Tomb is on one side of the Choir; there are
many other Relicks in this Church. You then descend a large
Stair-Case into the Church under Ground, where the Chappels visited
by the Curious, are full of Holy Bodies. There they shew you the Tomb
of S. <i>Eusebius</i>, and those of forty five Virgins who disfigur&#8217;d
themselves to terrifie the Vandals who put them to Death. Here also
you see St. <i>Andrew</i>&#8217;s Cross entire, the Branches whereof are seven
Foot long and eight Inches Diameter. In one of these subterraneous
Chappels is a little Grotto, wherein S. <i>Mary Magdalen</i> (they tell
you,) upon her Landing at <i>Marseilles</i> began to do Pennance. They
add, that she Inhabited it six or Seven Years: Her Statue likewise is
represented, lying at the entrance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> this Grotto. There is also a
rich Chappel of our Lady, wherein no Women are permitted to enter.
This Order was made, upon the Vulgar Notion, of a Queen&#8217;s being
struck Blind, who had the Temerity to venture into it.</p>

<p>&#8216;In <i>Marseilles</i> you observe likewise the Monasteries and Churches of
the <i>Carthusians</i>, the Monks of St. <i>Anthony</i>, the <i>Trinitarians</i>,
<i>Jacobins</i>, <i>Augustins</i>, Barefooted <i>Augustins</i>, <i>Carmelites</i>,
Barefooted <i>Carmelites</i>, <i>Cordeliers</i>, <i>Observantins</i>, <i>Servites</i>,
<i>Minims</i>, <i>Capuchins</i>, <i>Recollects</i>, <i>de la Mercy</i>, <i>Feuillans</i>,
<i>Jesuites</i>, Fathers of the <i>Oratory</i>, and of the <i>Mission</i>. There are
also <i>Benedictine</i> Nuns, <i>Dominicans</i>, Nuns of S. <i>Clare</i>,
<i>Capuchins</i>, <i>Carmelites</i>, <i>Bernardines</i>, <i>Urselins</i>, Nuns of the
Visitation of Mercy, and of the good Shepherd or Repentance; and a
Commandry of <i>Malta</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Citadel of <i>Marseilles</i> is near the Port, extending its
Fortifications to the Entrance of the same; and yet it commands the
Town. The Key which lines this side of the Harbour, from Fort S.
<i>Nicolas</i> to the Arsenal, is about fifteen hundred Paces long, and is
adorned with handsome Ware-Houses and Dwelling-Houses: Here is the
great Hospital for Sick Slaves, which was formerly the Arsenal before
the New one was built. Six large Pavilions, as many main Houses, and
a great square Place big enough to build several Galleys at a time
in, form the Design of it. In this Place are two large Basons, as
long and as deep as a Galley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> in each of which, when a Galley is
ready to launch, they open a small Sluice which kept up the Sea
Water.</p>

<p>&#8216;This great Building makes one entire Front of the Port, three
hundred Paces in Length; the Harbour of <i>Marseilles</i>, is thirteen
hundred Paces long, and the Circumference about three Thousand four
hundred and fifty Paces. The Streets of the old Town are long, but
narrow; and those of the New are spacious, and well Built. The chief,
is that they call <i>le Cours</i>, which is near forty Paces broad, in the
middle of which is a Walk, planted with four Rows of young Elms,
which, with the Keys, are the Places of publick Resort.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Town-House which they call <i>La Loge</i>, is situate upon the Key
over against the Galleys. Below is a large Hall, which serves the
Merchants and Sea-faring Men for an Exchange; and above Stairs the
Consuls, Town-Councellors, and others concerned in the Civil
Administration have their Meeting. The most valuable Piece in this
Building, is the City Arms in the Front, Carved by the famous
<i>Puget</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Marseilles</i> seems still to retain somewhat of the ancient
Government, of its four Courts, being divided into four Quarters,
viz. S. <i>John</i>, <i>Cavaillon</i>, <i>Corps de ville</i> and <i>Blancaire</i>; each
of which hath its Governors and other Officers. The <i>Porte Royalle</i>
is well Adorned, having on one side the Figure of S. <i>Lazarus</i>, and
on the other, that of S. <i>Victor</i>. And in the middle is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> a Busto of
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. with this Inscription over it, <i>Sub cujus imperio summa
libertas</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Town is encompass&#8217;d by good Walls, and a Tetragon which commands
a Part of it, is the best of the two Citadels, and within Cannon Shot
of a Fort call&#8217;d <i>Notre Dame de la Garde</i>, whither the Inhabitants
frequently go to pay their private Devotion, and from whence they
discover Ships at Sea at a great Distance. This Fort is built on the
top of a Mountain, upon the Ruins of an ancient Temple of <i>Venus</i>,
called <i>Ephesium</i>.</p></div>

<p>The Country about this City is low and open for two Miles, agreeably
adorn&#8217;d with Villas, Vineyards, and Gardens of Fig-Trees, and
Orange-Trees, with plenty of Water from a good Spring, which being divided
into several Branches serves to furnish the City.</p>

<p>As to the Inhabitants, they are for the most part Poor and uncleanly, and
chiefly Eaters of Fruit, Herbs, and Roots with such like meagre Fare, nor
do they take any Pains to clean the Streets where the meaner Sort have
their Habitation. Their Bread is very coarse and high priz&#8217;d; and perhaps
what has principally contributed to the Progress of the Plague among them,
was the great Numbers of those which Lodged together in the same House, as
I shall explain hereafter; when I have examin&#8217;d the State of <i>London</i>,
when it suffer&#8217;d by the Plague in the Year 1665.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><i>London</i>, at the time of the Plague, 1665 was, perhaps, as much crouded
with People as I suppose <i>Marseilles</i> to have been when the Plague begun;
the Streets of <i>London</i> were, in the time of the Pestilence, very narrow,
and, as I am inform&#8217;d, unpaved for the most part; the Houses by continu&#8217;d
Jetts one Story above another, made them almost meet at the Garrets, so
that the Air within the Streets was pent up, and had not a due Freedom of
Passage, to purifie it self as it ought; the Food of the People was then
much less invigorating than in these Days; Foreign Drugs were but little
in Use, and even <i>Canary</i> Wine was the highest Cordial the People would
venture upon; for Brandy, some Spices, and hot spirituous Liquors were
then not in Fashion; and at that time Sea-Coal was hardly in Use, but
their firing was of Wood; and, for the most part, Chestnut, which was then
the chief Furniture of the Woods about <i>London</i>, and in such Quantity,
that the greatest Efforts were made by the Proprietors, to prevent the
Importation of <i>Newcastle</i>-Coal, which they represented as an unwholsome
Firing, but, I suppose, principally, because it would hinder the Sale of
their Wood; for the generality of Men were (I imagine) as they are now,
more for their own Interest than for the common Good.</p>

<p>The Year 1665 was the last that we can say the Plague raged in <i>London</i>,
which might happen from the Destruction of the City by Fire, the following
Year 1666, and besides the Destroying the Eggs, or Seeds, of those
poisonous Animals, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> were then in the stagnating Air, might likewise
purifie that Air in such a Manner, as to make it unfit for the Nurishment
of others of the same Kind, which were swimming or driving in the
Circumambient Air: And again, the Care that was taken to enlarge the
Streets at their Rebuilding, and the keeping them clean after they were
rebuilt, might greatly contribute to preserve the Town from Pestilence
ever since.</p>

<p>But it was not only in the Year 1665 that the Plague raged in <i>London</i>, we
have Accounts in the Bills of Mortality, of that dreadful Distemper in the
Years 1592, 1603, 1625, 1630 and 1636, in which Years we may observe how
many died Weekly of the Plague, and Remark how much more that Distemper

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>We may observe from hence, that the Months <i>July</i>, <i>August</i>, <i>September</i>,
and <i>October</i>, the Plague was at the greatest height, and even in those
Months, all other Distempers had greater Power over Human Bodies than in
the others. When I consider this, I cannot help taking Notice, that in
those Months we have our chief Fruit Seasons, and when it happens that
there has been a Blight in the Spring, or the Summer has not given our
Fruit due Maturity, I suppose that the Habit of the Body is so disposed as
to receive Infection more readily, than in Years that either afford us
little, or else very Ripe Fruit.</p>

<p>Again, in those warm Months, I find that we have vast Varieties of the
smaller kinds of Insects floating in the Air, and it is a thing constant,
that every Insect from the greatest to the smallest has its proper <i>Nidus</i>
to hatch and perfect it self in, and is led thither by certain Effluvia
which arise from that Body which is in a right State for the preservation
of it. In the Blight of Trees we find, such Insects as are appointed to
destroy a Cherry Tree, will not injure a Tree of another Kind, and again,
unless the Leaves of some Trees are bruised by Hail, or otherwise
Distemper&#8217;d, no Insect will invade them; so in Animals it may be, that by
ill Diet the Habit of their Body may be so altered, that their very Breath
may entice those poisonous Insects to follow their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> way, &#8217;till they can
lodge themselves in the Stomach of the Animal, and thereby occasion Death.
We may likewise suppose that where these Insects have met with their
appointed Nests, they will certainly lay their Eggs there, which the
Breath of the diseased Person will fling out in Parcels, as he has
occasion to Respire; so that the Infection may be communicated to a
stander-by, or else, through their extraordinary smallness, may be
convey&#8217;d by the Air to some Distance.</p>

<p>It is observable, that all Insects are so much quicker in passing through
their several Stages to the state of Perfection, as they are smaller, and
the smallest of them are more numerous in their Increase than the others.</p>

<p>Two Years ago when the Plague was at <i>Amiens</i>, I pass&#8217;d by that Place, and
then found the Contagion began to abate (&#8217;twas then about <i>October</i>, and
the Rains began to fall) the People told me they were advised to eat
Garlick every Morning to guard their Stomachs against Infection; but
whether it was the Garlick, or the sudden alteration of the Season that
was the occasion of the decrease of that Distemper, we shall examine in
another Place; but we may Note, That all the Ground about that City is a
Morass, so that there is no coming near it but by the Roads which are
Paved and mark&#8217;d out. This Marsh or Morass, as all others do in the Summer
Season, produce vast Numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> Insects which are accounted unwholsome:
But as some are of Opinion, it is rather a Noxious Vapour which occasions
this Infectious Distemper, I shall mention my Opinion of such Vapours
before I conclude.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>In the</i> Philosophical Transactions, N<sup>o</sup> 8. <i>we have the following
Observations of Insects which are the Destroyers of Plants.</i></p>

<p>Some Years since there was such a swarm of a certain sort of Insect in
<i>New-England</i>, that for the space of 200 Miles they poisoned and destroyed
all the Trees of the Country; there being found innumerable little Holes
in the Ground, out of which those Insects broke forth in the Form of
<i>Maggots</i>, which turn&#8217;d into <i>Flies</i> that had a kind of Sting, which they
stuck into the Tree, and thereby envenom&#8217;d and killed it.</p>

<p>The like Plague is said to happen frequently in the Country of the
<i>Cossacks</i> or <i>Ukrani</i>, where, in dry Summers, they are infested with
swarms of <i>Locusts</i>, driven thither by an <i>East</i>, or <i>South-East</i> Wind,
that they darken the Air in the fairest Weather, and devour all the Corn
of that Country, laying their Eggs in Autumn, and then dying; but the
Eggs, of which every one layeth two or three Hundred, hatching the next
Spring, produce again such a number of <i>Locusts</i>, that then they do far
more mischief than before, unless Rains fall which kill both Eggs and
Insects, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> unless a strong <i>North</i> or <i>North-West</i> Wind arise, which
drives them into the <i>Euxine</i> Sea: And it is very natural to suppose, that
if the Winds have this Power over the larger sort of Insects; <i>i. e.</i> of
moving them from one Country to another, the smaller kinds, which are
lighter than the Air it self, may be interceptibly Convey&#8217;d as far as the
Winds can reach.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Dr.</i> Wincler, <i>Chief Physician of the Prince</i> Palatine, <i>gives us the
following Account of the</i> Murrain <i>in</i> Switzerland, <i>and the Method of its
Cure, in a Letter to Dr.</i> Slare, <i>F. R. S. Anno</i> 1682.</p>

<p>On the Borders of <i>Italy</i> a <i>Murrain</i> infested the Cattle which spread
farther into <i>Switzerland</i>, the Territories of <i>Wirtemburg</i>, and over
other Provinces, and made great destruction among them. The Contagion
seem&#8217;d to propagate it self in the form of a <i>Blue Mist</i>, that fell upon
those Pastures where the Cattle Grazed, insomuch that Herds have returned
home Sick, being very dull, forbearing their Food, most of them would die
away in twenty four Hours. Upon dissections were discovered large and
corrupted Spleens, sphacelous and corroded Tongues, some had <i>Angina
Maligna&#8217;s</i>. Those Persons that carelesly managed their Cattle without a
due respect to their own Health, were themselves Infected and Died away
like their Beasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Having had timely Notice of this <i>Lues</i> from our Neighbours, we made such
Provision against the invading Disease, that very few of those who were
infected by the Murrain died. Some impute this Contagion to the Witchcraft
of three <i>Capuchins</i> in <i>Switzerland</i>. But the more learned believe it to
proceed from some <i>noxious Exhalations</i> thrown out of the Earth by three
distinct Earthquakes perceived here and in our Neighbourhood in the Space
of one Year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>The Method of Cure for the Cattle.</i></p>

<p>As soon as ever there was any suspicion of the Contagion upon any one of
the Herd, the Tongue of that Beast was carefully examined, and in case
they found any Aptha or Blisters whether White, Yellow, or Black, then
they were obliged to rub, and scratch the Tongue with a Silver Instrument
(being about the breadth and thickness of a Six-pence, but indented on the
sides, and having a Hole in the middle whereby it is fastened to a Stick,
or Handle,) &#8217;till it Bleed, then they must wipe away the Blood with new
unwashen Linnen. This done, a Lotion for the Tongue is used, made of
<i>Salt</i> and good <i>Vinegar</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Antidote</i> for the diseased Cattle is thus described.</p>

<p>Take of <i>Soot</i>, <i>Gun-Powder</i>, <i>Brimstone</i>, <i>Salt</i>, equal Parts, and as
much Water as is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> to wash it down, give a large Spoonful for a
Dose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>After which we have a further Account of the same Contagion by the same Hand.</i></p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;I lately received an Account of two ingenious Travellers, who assured
me the Contagion had reached their Quarters on the Borders of <i>Poland</i>,
having passed quite through <i>Germany</i>, and that the Method used in our
Relation preserved and cured their Cattle. They told me the Contagion was
observed to make its Progress Dayly, spreading near two <i>German</i> Miles in
twenty four Hours. This they say was certainly observed by many curious
Persons, that it continually, without intermission, made progressive
Voyages, and suffered no neighbouring Parish to escape; so that it did not
at the same time infect Places at great distances. They added, that Cattle
secured at Rack and Manger, were equally infected with those in the Field.
It were worth the considering, whether this Infection is not carried on by
some volatile Insect, that is able to make only such short flights as may
amount to such Computations: For the account of the Ancients concerning
the grand <i>pestilential Contagions</i>, is very little satisfactory to this
Age, who derive it from a blind Putrefaction, from the incantations of ill
Men, or from the conjunction of inauspicious Planets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">The following Account we have from Dr. <i>Bernard Ramizzini</i>,
concerning the Contagion among the Black Cattle about <i>Padua</i>,
Translated from <i>Acta Erudit</i>.</p>

<p>In the Year 1712 a dreadful and violent Contagion seiz&#8217;d the <i>Black
Cattle</i>, which, like an increasing Fire, could neither be extinguish&#8217;d nor
stopt by any Human means.</p>

<p>This First was observ&#8217;d in <i>Agro Vincentino</i>, and Discover&#8217;d it self more
openly in the Country, spreading every way, even to the very Suburbs of
<i>Padua</i>, with a cruel Destruction of the Cows and Oxen. It was also in
<i>Germany</i>, in many Places; and is not yet wholly conquer&#8217;d.</p>

<p>Of this Distemper, Dr. <i>Ramazzini</i> made a particular Dissertation; in
which he inquir&#8217;d into the Causes of the Distemper, and what Remedies
might be us&#8217;d, to put a stop to its violent Course.</p>

<p>It is evident, that this Distemper in Cows and Oxen was a true Fever, from
the coldness of the Cattle at first, which was soon succeeded by a violent
burning, with a quick Pulse. That this Fever was pestilential, its
concomitant Symptoms plainly show, as difficulty of breathing, a
Drowziness at the beginning; a continued Flux of a nauseous Matter from
the Nose and Mouth, fetid Dung, sometimes with Blood, Pustules breaking
out over the whole Body on the fifth or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> sixth Day, like the <i>Small-Pox</i>;
they generally dyed about the fifth or seventh Day.</p>

<p>The Author tells us, that out of a great Drove, such as the Merchants
bring yearly into <i>Italy</i> out of <i>Dalmatia</i> and the bordering Countries,
one Beast happen&#8217;d to straggle from the rest, and be left behind; which a
Cowherd brought to a Farm belonging to the Count <i>Borromeo</i>: This Beast
infected all the Cows and Oxen of the Place where he was taken in, with
the same Distemper he labour&#8217;d under; the Beast it self dying in a few
Days, as did all the rest, except one only, who had a Rowel put into his
Neck.</p>

<p>&#8217;Tis no strange thing therefore, if from the Effluvia, proceeding from the
sick and dead Cattle, and from the Cow-Houses and Pastures where they were
fed, and perhaps from the Cloaths of the Cowherds themselves, this
Infection falling upon a proper Subject, should diffuse it self so
largely. When therefore this subtile <i>venomous Exhalation</i> happens to meet
with any of the Cow-kind, joining it self with the serous Juices and
Animal Spirits, &#8217;tis no wonder it should disorder the natural Consistence
of the Blood, and corrupt the Ferments of the Viscera; whence it follows,
that the natural Functions of the Viscera are vitiated, and the requisite
Secretions stopt. For Dr. <i>Ramazzini</i> not only supposes, but asserts, that
a Poison of this kind, rather fixes and coagulates, than dissolves the
Blood: For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> beside the forementioned Symptoms accompanying the Disease,
the Eye it self is a Witness; since the dead Carcases being open&#8217;d while
they are yet hot, little or no Blood runs out; those Animals having
naturally a thick Blood, especially when the fever has continued so many
Days. And he adds, that whether this Plague came first from the Foreign
Beast, or any other way, it only had its Effect upon some Animal, in which
there was the morbid Seminary or Ground prepared for it.</p>

<p>In the dead Bodies of all the Cattle, it was particularly observ&#8217;d, that
in the Omasus, or Paunch, there was found a hard compact Body, firmly
adhering to the Coats of the Ventricle, of a large Bulk, and an
intolerable Smell: In other Parts, as in the Brain, Lungs, <i>&amp;c.</i> were
several Hydatides, and large Bladders fill&#8217;d only with Wind, which being
open&#8217;d, gave a disagreeable Stink: there were also Ulcers at the Root of
the Tongue; and Bladders fill&#8217;d with a Serum on the sides of it. This hard
and compact Body, like Chalk, in the Omasus, the Author takes to be the
full Product of the contagious Miasma. He adds a Prognostick, believing
that from so many Attempts and Experiments, and the Method observ&#8217;d in the
Cure of this Venom, at last a true and specifick Remedy will be found out
to extirpate the poisonous Malignity wholly: He also expects some
mitigation of it, from the approaching Winter and North Winds. He does
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> think this Contagion can affect Human Bodies, since even other
Species of ruminating Animals, symbolizing with the Cow-kind, are yet
untouch&#8217;d by it; nor was the Infection taken by the Air, after the dead
Bodies had been carefully Buryed.</p>

<p>As for the Cure of it: From the Chirurgical part, he commends <i>Bleeding</i>,
burning on both sides the Neck with a broad red-hot Iron, making Holes in
the Ears with a round Iron, and putting the Root Hellebore in the Hole, a
<i>Rowel</i> or <i>Seton</i> under the <i>Chin</i>, in the <i>Dew-laps</i>; he also orders the
<i>Tongue</i> and <i>Palate</i> to be often wash&#8217;d and rub&#8217;d with <i>Vinegar</i> and
<i>Salt</i>.</p>

<p>He recommends the Use of <i>Alexipharmicks</i>, and specifick Cordials; and
three Ounces of Jesuits Bark, infus&#8217;d in ten or twelve Pints of Cordial
Water or small Wine, to be given in four or five Doses; which is to be
done in the beginning of the Fever, when the Beast begins to be Sick. Or
else two Drams of <i>Sperma-C&aelig;ti</i> dissolv&#8217;d in warm Wine. Again he
prescribes <i>Antimonium Diaphoreticum</i>. Against Worms breeding, an Infusion
of Quicksilver, or <i>Petroleum</i> and Milk is to be given. And lastly, as to
the Food, he directs Drinks made with Barley or Wheat Flower or Bread,
like a <i>Ptisane</i>, fresh sweet Hay made in <i>May</i> and macerated in fair
Water. In the mean time the Cattle must be kept in a warm Place, and
Cloath&#8217;d, daily shaking Fumigations in the Cow-Houses with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> Juniper
Berries, Galbanum, and the like. As to Prevention, he enjoyns Care in
cleaning the Stalls, and scraping the Crust off from the Wall; Care also
is to be taken of their Food, the Hay and Straw not spoil&#8217;d by Rain in the
Making; and he judges their Food ought to be but sparing: He likewise
recommends currying, with a Comb and Brush; with Setons under their Chin,
made with a hot Iron run through the Part, and kept open with a Rope put
through it.</p>

<p>After which we have the Receipt: Or the Ingredients of a Medicine for the
speedy Cure of that mortal Distemper amongst Cows; sent over from
<i>Holland</i>, where a like Distemper raged among the Black Cattel.</p>

<p>Bleed the Cow, and give her three or 4 Mornings successively, an Ounce of
this Powder, with a Horn, in warm Beer.</p>

<p>If the Cow continues Distemper&#8217;d, after the Omission 2 or 3 Days, repeat
the Medicine for 3 or 4 Days again.</p>

<p>I cannot help taking Notice likewise of the raging Distemper which was
among the Cows about <i>London</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1714. It was so Violent and
Infectious, that if <i>one</i> had it, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> others that came within Scent of
her, or even eat where she Grazed, were surely infected; it seized their
Heads, and was attended with running at the Nose, and a very nauseous
Breath, which killed them in three or four Days. The Herdsmen would not
allow it to be the <i>Murrain</i>, nor could give any Account from whence it
did proceed, or could find out any Remedy against it; they only tell us
the unusual dry Summer, and the continued <i>East</i>-Winds, were the occasion
of it. This Distemper had been for two or three Years before it came to
us, in <i>Lombardy</i>, <i>Holland</i>, and <i>Hambrough</i>, to the Loss almost of all
their Cattle. The States of <i>Holland</i> caused a Medicine to be published
for the Good of those who had their Cattle thus Distemper&#8217;d; but having
been try&#8217;d here, &#8217;twould not Cure one in seven, but rather increased the
Infection by keeping the distemper&#8217;d Cattle longer alive (by some Days)
than they would have been without it. &#8217;Tis remarkable, that no Oxen had
this Distemper, but only <i>Milch-Cows</i>, which were more tender than the
<i>Males</i>. The Herdsmen to keep their Cattle from the Infection, let them
Blood in the Tail, and rubb&#8217;d their Noses and Chaps with <i>Tar</i>; and when
any happened to die of it, they were burnt, and buried deep under Ground.
It began at <i>Islington</i>, spreading it self over many Places in <i>Middlesex</i>
and in <i>Essex</i>, but did not reach so far <i>Westward</i> from <i>London</i> as
twenty Miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>The most general Opinion concerning the Cause of this Distemper, was, that
the Cattle were first infected by drinking some unwholesome standing
Water, where &#8217;tis probable some Poisonous Insects were lodged and bred;
the Summer having been extreamly dry, attended almost constantly with
<i>Easterly</i> Winds, the Grass almost burnt up, and the Herbs of the Gardens
destroyed by Insects; but such as they were, (unfit for Table Use) were
given to the Cattle. There was likewise so great want of Water, that many
were forced to drive their Cows five or six Miles to it.</p>

<p>The Electuary publish&#8217;d upon this Occasion by the States of <i>Holland</i>, was
compos&#8217;d of most, if not all the Drugs used in the most serviceable
Medicines that were made use of against the Plague among Men; most of
which Ingredients we know to be mortal to Insects, as strong scented Roots
and Herbs; but above all, Aromatick Gums and Saps of Plants; as Rhue,
Garlick, Pitch, Tar, Frankincense and Olibanum. These Ingredients are much
used in <i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i> to prevent or destroy Infection, by burning
them and smoaking such Bodies, Letters, or any other things as are brought
from infected Places, after they have made <i>Quarantain</i>, and are not
suffered to come on Shore &#8217;till they have undergone this Operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>It is not against Experience, that Insects can live and encrease in Animal
Bodies: How often do we find Men, Women and Children troubled with Worms?
What Varieties of those Insects are often voided by them? And how should
that be, if they were not either suck&#8217;d into the Stomach with the Breath,
or taken into it with some unwholesome Food? For they cannot breed in such
Bodies from nothing, without either their Eggs or themselves are brought
thither by some Accident: For if they were the natural Produce of Animal
Bodies, they would then be alike common to all, which we know they are
not.</p>

<p>I have been informed, that in the Year 1714, when this Mortality among the
Cows was at its height, that towards the End of the Summer, some Farmers
brought in fresh Cattel, and turning them into the same Fields, where many
Cows had died before, they took the Infection and died likewise; but the
following Spring those Fields were void of Infection, and the <i>Cows</i> that
were put into them did very well, but what were then put into the
<i>Cow-Houses</i>, where the sick <i>Cows</i> had been the Year before, were seiz&#8217;d
with the Distemper, and died; which seems to inform us, that it was the
Effect of <i>Insects</i>, which thro&#8217; the Warmth of those Stalls were preserv&#8217;d
from the Severity of the Winter&#8217;s Frost; but such as were left in the open
Fields were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> destroy&#8217;d by the Cold. I have heard that a Woman about
<i>Camberwell</i> cured Six in Seven of her <i>Cows</i>, by giving them once a Week
an Infusion of <i>Rhue</i> and <i>Ale-wort</i>.</p>

<p>But it may be ask&#8217;d, why these infectious Distempers, subject to Men,
Cattle and Plants, are not universal? And why the Plague should not be as
well in <i>India</i>, <i>China</i>, the South Parts of <i>Africa</i> and <i>America</i>, as in
these Parts of the World? (For I do not find it has ever been in those
Places.) This Query gives me a farther Opportunity to suggest, that
Insects are the Cause of it, and that they are brought with the Easterly
Winds. In the first place, so far as I can learn, there is not naturally
in <i>America</i> any one Kind of Creature or Insect that is found in any other
Part of the World, and the Plants likewise are all different from those of
other Countries; as it is the same in <i>India</i>, <i>China</i>, &amp;c. whose Products
are quite different from what we find elsewhere. Supposing then that these
pestiferous Insects are only the Produce of <i>Tartary</i>, let us consider to
what Parts of the World they may be carry&#8217;d from thence with the Easterly
Winds; and whether <i>India</i>, <i>China</i>, the South of <i>Africa</i> and <i>America</i>,
are not beyond their Reach, or can reasonably be affected by them.</p>

<p>Whoever considers the Disposition of the Land and Water in the Globe, may
thus account for the Passage of these Insects, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> an Easterly Wind from
<i>Tartary</i>, to all the Parts of <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia-Minor</i>, <i>Palestine</i>,
<i>Barbary</i>, and other South Coasts of the <i>Mediterranean Sea</i>, whither,
&#8217;tis highly probable, they may come, without meeting any thing in their
Way to obstruct their Course.</p>

<p>The best Maps do not lay down any Mountains of Note between <i>Tartary</i> and
the places which have been subject to the Plague: The <i>Alps</i> run parallel
with the Winds coming from <i>Tartary</i>, and therefore does not any Way
hinder their Passage: The Mountains of <i>Dalmatia</i> are not high enough to
prevent the Passage; or if they were, the <i>Caspian Sea</i> is sufficiently
large to let them pass to the South Parts of <i>Europe</i>, the <i>Mediterranean
Sea</i>, and the North Coasts of <i>Africa</i>, even to their most Western Bounds.</p>

<p>Now it may be expected, perhaps, by some, that these Winds should yet
continue their Progress as far as <i>America</i>; but as yet, so far as I can
learn, these Land-Winds, when they have blown with the greatest Force, and
have been of the longest Continuance, have not reach&#8217;d farther than about
three hundred Leagues beyond the Western Coasts of <i>Europe</i>, which is a
Trifle in Comparison of the vast Ocean between us and <i>America</i>: Besides,
it is my Opinion, that the Winds which blow over so vast a Tract of Land,
as these <i>Tartarian</i> Winds must do, that I suppose convey and support the
pestiferous Insects, are of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> different a Nature from the Winds coming
from the Ocean, that &#8217;tis likely those Creatures which would subsist in
the one, would be destroy&#8217;d by the other: So that if I am right in this
Conjecture, <i>America</i> cannot be subject to the Plague.</p>

<p><i>Mount-Atlas</i>, which is a vast Ridge of Mountains, running from the Ocean
almost as far as <i>Egypt</i>, and are back&#8217;d with the Desarts of <i>Lybia</i>, may
very likely obstruct the Passage of these Insects to the South of
<i>Africa</i>; and for that Reason, perhaps, secure that part of the World from
Plagues. So likewise <i>Mount-Caucasus</i>, or <i>Ararat</i>, which is one of the
highest Ridge of Mountains in the World, running from East to West, thro&#8217;
<i>Persia</i> and <i>India</i>, may secure the South Parts of those Countries from
the Plague, by stopping the Passage of those infectious Creatures, if any
Winds from <i>Tartary</i> should happen to blow them that Way: And as <i>China</i>
lies to the East of <i>Tartary</i>, so it must be Westerly Winds which must
infect that Country with the Plague, if it proceeds from what I imagine:
But we do not yet find that Westerly Winds are frequent in those Parts; or
if they are, we may be assur&#8217;d they cannot blow at the same time when the
Insects are hatch&#8217;d and carried the contrary Way by the Wind from
<i>Tartary</i>. We are inform&#8217;d, that upon the Coast of <i>China</i>, the Winds are
so regular, that from <i>October</i> to <i>March</i> they continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> blow from the
North-East, and from that Month to <i>October</i>, the direct contrary Way.</p>

<p>And Plants are no less subject to be destroy&#8217;d by Insects, than Men and
Quadrupedes, is I have explain&#8217;d in the Chapter of Blights, in my <i>New
Improvements of Planting and Gardening</i>.</p>

<p><i>Plants</i> of all degrees are subject to Blights, which are so variously
communicated to them, that sometimes a whole Tree will perish by that
Distemper; now and then a few Leaves, or Blossoms only, and perhaps a
Branch or two, will be shrivel&#8217;d, or scorch&#8217;d by it, and the rest remain
green and flourishing. I have yet never observ&#8217;d this Disease to happen
among Plants, but upon the blowing of sharp and clear <i>Easterly</i> Winds,
which are most frequent in <i>England</i> about <i>March</i>; but sometimes happen
in other Months. It is very observable, that the <i>Caterpillars</i> generally
attend these Winds, chiefly infecting some one sort of Tree more than
another, and even then not every where upon the kind of Tree they attack,
but some particular Branches only; from which Observations I think we may
draw the following Inferences, either that the Eggs of those Insects are
brought to us by the <i>Easterly</i> Winds, or that the Temperature of the Air,
when the <i>Easterly</i> Winds blow, is necessary to hatch those Creatures,
supposing their Eggs were already laid upon those infected Parts of the
Trees the preceding Year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>The Blights which are attended with large <i>Worms</i> or <i>Caterpillars</i>, seem
to be rather hatch&#8217;d with the <i>East</i> Wind, than that the Eggs of those
Creatures are brought along with it; but those Blights which produce only
those small Insects which occasion the curling of the Leaves of Trees, may
proceed from Swarms of them, either hatch&#8217;d or in the Egg, which are
brought with the Wind.</p>

<p>Some perhaps may object, that the <i>East</i> Wind is too cold to hatch these
Creatures; how comes it then that we find them hatch&#8217;d when those Winds
reign? Or is it reasonable to conjecture that the same degree of Heat is
necessary to enliven an Insect as is required to hatch the Egg of a
Pullet? The Insects of <i>Norway</i>, <i>Iceland</i>, and such like cold Climes,
must certainly have less Heat to produce them, than Creatures of the same
Race must necessarily have in those Climates which lye nearer to the Sun.
Every Creature, without doubt, requires a different Period of Heat or Cold
to enliven it, and put it in Motion, which is prov&#8217;d by so many known
Instances, that I conceive there is no room for any dispute upon that
score.</p>

<p>But there may yet be another Question, <i>viz.</i> Whether it is not the <i>East</i>
Wind of it self that blights, without the help of <i>Insects</i>? But that may
be easily resolved on my side; for that if it was the Wind alone that
blighted, then every Plant in its way must unavoidably be infected with
its Poison; whereas we find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> contrary on a single Branch it may be, or
some other distinct Part of Plants.</p>

<p>And again, to shew how reasonably we may conjecture that &#8217;tis <i>Insects</i>
which thus infect the Trees, let us only consider, that every <i>Insect</i> has
its proper <i>Plant</i>, or Tribe of <i>Plants</i>, which it naturally requires for
its Nourishment, and will feed upon no other kind whatsoever: Therefore
&#8217;tis no wonder to see one particular sort of Tree blighted, when all
others escape; as for Example, that Wind which brings or hatches the
<i>Caterpillars</i> upon the <i>Apple-Trees</i>, will not any way infect the <i>Pear</i>,
<i>Plumb</i>, or <i>Cherry</i> with <i>Blights</i>, because, were the Shoals of <i>Insects</i>
natural to the <i>Apple</i>, to light only upon those other Trees mentioned,
they would then want their proper Matrix to hatch in; or if they were
hatch&#8217;d already, they would Perish for want of their natural Food; so that
&#8217;tis morally impossible that all sorts of Trees should be blighted at the
same time, unless the Eggs of every kind of <i>Insect</i>, natural to each
Tree, could be brought at one time with the Wind, or that an Easterly Wind
could contain in it at once, as many differing Periods of Cold or Heat, as
would be requir&#8217;d to hatch and maintain each differing kind of those
Creatures.</p>

<p>The common People in the Country seem to be of my Opinion, that Blights
are brought by the East Winds, which they are so well satisfied brings or
hatches the <i>Caterpillar</i>, that to prevent the too great Progress of
Blights, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> is common for them when the East Winds blow, to provide large
Heaps of Weeds, Chaff, and other combustible Matter on the Windside of
their Orchards, and set them on Fire, that the Smoak may poison either the
<i>Insects</i> or their Eggs, as they are pass&#8217;d along. By this Contrivance I
have often known large Orchards preserv&#8217;d, when the neighbouring Parts
have suffer&#8217;d to the Loss of all their Fruit.</p>

<p>And I have also seen these Fires made with good Success to destroy the
<i>Caterpillars</i>, even after they were hatch&#8217;d, and had began to devour the
Trees, by suffocating them, and forcing them to drop to the Ground, where
they have been swept up in large Quantities, and kill&#8217;d. I have heard it
affirm&#8217;d by a Gentleman of Reputation, that <i>Pepper-Dust</i>, being powder&#8217;d
upon the <i>Blossoms</i> of any Tree, will preserve them from Blights, which
may be, because <i>Pepper</i> is said to be present Death to every Creature but
to Mankind. Now altho&#8217; this last Secret is too costly for common Use, yet
it may be of Service in some particular Place for the Tryal of a new Tree,
where a Taste of the Fruit is desired, and besides it helps to inform us,
that Blights are occasion&#8217;d by Insects, or their Eggs, lodging upon a
Plant, and that <i>Pepper Dust</i> will not suffer them either to live, or to
be hatch&#8217;d.</p>

<p>Another Remark (which to me is Demonstration) that Blights proceed from
<i>Insects</i>, or their Eggs (being brought with the Easterly Winds) was the
total Destruction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> <i>Turneps</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 1716, on the West Side of
<i>London</i>; about <i>October</i> we had dry Easterly Winds for a Week or ten
Days, and several thousand Acres of <i>Turneps</i>, which were then well grown,
turn&#8217;d Yellow and decay&#8217;d, unless in such Places only as were shelter&#8217;d by
Hedges, Houses, or Trees, where they remain&#8217;d Green &#8217;till the <i>Insects</i>,
which came with the Wind, in about a Week&#8217;s Time, destroy&#8217;d those also.
Some Farmers imagin&#8217;d that the Birds which were there in great Flocks, had
eaten the Leaves of their <i>Turneps</i>, and contriv&#8217;d all Means possible to
destroy them, &#8217;till I convinc&#8217;d them that the Birds were rather Friends
than Enemies and came there to feed upon the <i>Caterpillars</i>, which were in
such great Numbers, that each <i>Turnep-plant</i> had not less than a Thousand
upon it; and that <i>Insects</i> frequently pass in Clouds and numberless
Armies after this manner, is plain from several Instances, which have
happen&#8217;d in my Time, and one of them (I think in <i>June, Ann.</i> 1717)
passing over <i>London</i> were suffocated (I suppose) with the Smoak of the
Sea-Coal, and drop&#8217;d down in the Streets, insomuch that a square Court
belonging to the <i>Royal Society</i> was almost cover&#8217;d with them; these were
of the <i>Fly Kind</i>, and fully perfected.</p>

<p>It may be asked, perhaps, how these <i>Insects</i> came to destroy the
<i>Turneps</i> only, and not touch the other Greens of the Fields, as
<i>Cabbages</i>, <i>Carrots</i>, <i>Parsnips</i>, and the like? Every Herb has its
peculiar <i>Insect</i>, like the Trees I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> have mention&#8217;d: Nay more than this,
the <i>Insects</i> which Nature hath design&#8217;d to prey upon the Flower of a
Plant, will not eat the Leaves, or any other Part of the same Plant. The
Leaves of Plants have their <i>Insects</i> natural to them, the Bark and Wood
likewise have their respective Devourers; and those several <i>Insects</i> have
other Kinds, which lay their Eggs, and feed upon them.</p>

<p>I could yet give a much larger Account of Animals and Plants, how they
have been particularly Infected, but I rather choose to refer my Reader to
the Chapter at large, of <i>Blights</i> and <i>Plagues</i>, in my <i>New Improvements
of Planting and Gardening</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>By the foregoing Accounts we may observe, that <i>Mankind</i>, <i>Quadrupedes</i>
and <i>Plants</i> seem to be infected in the same manner, by unwholesome
<i>Insects</i>; only allowing this Difference, that the same <i>Insect</i> which is
poisonous to Man, is not so to other Animals or Plants, and so on the
contrary; we observe likewise, that Pepper which is of Use to Mankind, is
poisonous to other Creatures, and tho&#8217; a Man cannot eat of the <i>Cicuta</i>,
or <i>Hemlock</i>, without prejudice, yet a <i>Cow</i> and some other Animals will
eat it to their Advantage; and the <i>Manchanese</i> Apple, which is deadly
Poison to almost every Creature, is eaten greedily by Goats, and which is
strange, the Milk of those Goats is wholesome to Mankind. Again, we may
remark that <i>Camphire</i> which may be taken at the Mouth by the Human Race,
and is helpful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> many Cases, will destroy <i>Insects</i>; for among the
Curious who have Cabinets of Rarities, it is a common Practice to lay it
in their Drawers and Cases, to destroy the smaller kind of <i>Insects</i>,
which would otherwise devour their Collections.</p>

<p>The Smoaking of Tobacco is helpful to some Constitutions, but was the pure
Leaf to be taken directly into the Stomach, it would Purge in a violent
Manner, and the Oil of it as I am told is a deadly Poison; however it is
to be remarked, that in the time of the last Plague in <i>London</i>, <i>Anno</i>
1665, that Distemper did not reach those who smoak&#8217;d Tobacco every Day,
but particularly it was judged the best to smoak in a Morning. We have an
Account of a famous Physician, who in the Pestilential time took every
Morning a Cordial to guard his Stomach, and after that a Pipe or two
before he went to visit his Patients; at the same time we are told, he had
an Issue in his Arm, by which, when it begun to smart, he knew he had
received some Infection, (as he says) and then had recourse to his Cordial
and his Pipe, by this means only he preserved himself, as several others
did at that time by the same Method. I suppose therefore, that the Smoak
of Tobacco is noxious to these Venomous <i>Insects</i>, which I believe to be
the Cause of the Plague, either by mixing it self with the Air and there
destroying them, or else by provoking the Stomach to discharge it self of
those Morbid Juices which would nourish and encourage them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>When I consider that the dead Bodies of the miserable People of
<i>Marseilles</i> were found full of <i>Insects</i>, and that those Worms could be
no way so suddenly killed, as by putting Oil or Lemon Juice upon them, it
brings to my Mind several Tryals I have made upon <i>Insects</i> of various
Kinds, in order to occasion their speedy Death. In these Experiments, I
found that most of the larger Kinds would live some Minutes in Spirit of
Wine and other spirituous Liquors, when they were forced into them, and
that Oil immediately suffocated them, from whence I suppose, the Air, or
Breath they draw, is exceeding fine and subtile, and that a thick Air
consists of too gross Parts for them to breath, and that since Oil
destroys the larger Kinds of them immediately, the Oleagenous Particles
evaporating from such Bodies as Oil, Pitch, Tar, <i>&amp;c.</i> expanding
themselves, and mixing with the common Air, would render it too thick for
the smaller Kinds to subsist in.</p>

<p>We observe likewise that all <i>Aromatick Herbs</i>, &amp;c. were found useful in
the time of the dreadful Pestilence in 1665, which helps to confirm what I
have just now related, for a single Leaf of Rosemary contains at least 500
little Bladders of Oily Juice, which by rubbing, break and afford that
grateful Smell we find in that Plant, but in that as in all other
<i>Aromatick Herbs</i>, was we to bruise the Leaves &#8217;till all those Bladders
were broken, the recreating Smell would be lost, and we should find only
remaining an earthy, disagreeable Flavour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> arising from the common
undigested Sap; so if we take the Leaves of Fifty several Kinds of
Aromatick Plants, and after bruising them, make up distinctly the bruis&#8217;d
Leaves of each into Balls, and dry them by the Sun, or otherwise, they
will all afford the same Smell; for the breaking of those Bladders, or
Blisters, which yield the different Smells (from the Essence they
severally contain) makes them lose all their Spirit or Essence.</p>

<p>In the Culture of these Aromatick Herbs, such as <i>Rosemary</i>, <i>Lavender</i>,
<i>Thyme</i>, &amp;c. we may remark, that they are never destroy&#8217;d by any <i>Insect</i>,
which may still give us a further Proof of the Antipathy all <i>Insects</i>
have to them, for which Reason some People are used to smoak their Houses
with these Aromatick Herbs, but especially where the Chambers or Rooms are
small and close; and it has been proved, that the Burning of Aromatick
Gums and Woods, have likewise been useful in purifying the Air in a House,
and preventing the Spreading of Pestilential Distempers.</p>

<p>In 1665 it was observable, that in <i>Aldermanbury</i>, and other Places, where
there were large Ware-Houses of Aromatick Druggs, the Infection did not
reach; so that it seems where there is Quantity enough of such Woods or
Gums, as yield a strong Smell, we have no Occasion of burning them, the
bare Effluvia rising from a large Mass, having the same Effect as burning
a small Quantity. As every one of these Druggs, or Gums, is more pungent
or operative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> upon the Organs of Smelling, so we may be assured, the
Vapour proceeding from them fill a larger Space in the Air; but perhaps a
Tun Weight of the strongest Aromatick among them, in the Body or Mass,
will not purifie so much Air as half an Ounce of the same will do by
burning; for the Smoak of a few Grains of <i>Tobacco</i>, when the Air is
clear, will sensibly touch the Smell above forty Yards, tho&#8217; a Pound of
the Herb unburnt will not affect the Smell above a Foot.</p>

<p>These Observations may serve to inform us, that the burning of Aromaticks
may help to keep the Air in an healthful State; but as Men of Business
must often change their Station, and pass thro&#8217; different Degrees and
Tempers of Air, it is for that Reason, that Aromaticks, and strong
smelling Roots, Herbs, <i>&amp;c.</i> are recommended to be taken into the Stomach.
The Cordial which we call <i>Plague-water</i>, compos&#8217;d of Aromatick Herbs, has
been used with Success, as has also been Conserves of <i>Rhue</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> and
the Use of <i>Garlick</i> in the <i>Amiens</i> Distemper, particularly, is
remarkable. To this I may likewise add a Relation I had lately from some
Men of Quality concerning a <i>Plague</i>, which some Years since destroy&#8217;d a
great part of the <i>French</i> Army: It was observable, that at that time the
<i>Irish</i> Regiments in that Service were preserv&#8217;d by rubbing their Bread
every Morning with <i>Garlick</i>, which undoubtedly must taint their Breath
for many Hours, and so regulate the Air about them, that the unwholesome
<i>Insects</i> could not approach them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Upon this Occasion, I cannot omit observing the extraordinary Remedy for
destroying the Insect call&#8217;d the <i>Wevil</i> in Corn or Malt, as it was
communicated to me by the Learned Dr. <i>Bentley</i>, Master of Trinity
College, <i>Cambridge</i>; that worthy Gentleman tells me, that the Herb
<i>Parietaria</i>, or <i>Peletory of the Wall</i>, is a Sovereign Remedy against the
<i>Wevil</i> in Corn or Malt; and according to the Information he has had, an
Handful of that Plant being laid here and there in a Granary infected by
those Insects, will infallibly destroy them in a Day or two; which
Discovery is so useful, that I think it ought to be made as publick as
possible, and in this place serves to confirm my Hypothesis, That the
Effluvia of some Plants are Destructive to Insects.</p>

<p>In the next place I come to consider, how much a certain Quantity of Air
is requisite to preserve a single Animal Body, and the Knowledge of that,
is what I account one of the chief Preservatives of Health. I have often
been concern&#8217;d to find a Family of six or seven pinn&#8217;d up in a Room, that
has not contain&#8217;d Air enough for the Maintenance of Health in one single
Person; but such is the Hardship of our Poor in many Places, and is
frequently the Occasion of their Death.</p>

<p>We may easily conceive how this happens, if we examine the Case of the
Diving Tub, how short a while a Man can live it, without a Supply of fresh
Air; the occasion of which is, that when he has drawn in with his Breath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
all the Grosser Parts from the Air enclos&#8217;d in the Tub, the rest grows hot
and suffocating, by being too much rarified.</p>

<p>From whence I suppose, a Room of Nine or Ten Foot Cube, will contain Air
enough to keep a single Man alive for one Day, but if two were to inhabit
that Space for the same time, each would receive but half his Nourishment,
and so both would be Sufferers; but a Room, perhaps, containing twice that
Space, might well enough serve five People for a Day, supposing that all
External Air was kept from Communication with such a Room, during the time
the People were in it; for, as I have observ&#8217;d, that Air has certain
Nourishing Qualities in it, for the Maintenance of Human Life; so when
those Nourishing Parts are imbibed, and drawn in by the Lungs, the Air is
return&#8217;d and flung out as invalid, and cannot be of Use a second Time to
the same Person; an Example of which, we find very curiously demonstrated
by Mr. <i>Newyentyte</i>; he tells us, that in making this Experiment, he
discover&#8217;d that the same Nourishing Quality in the Air, which is necessary
to maintain Human Life, is also necessary to maintain Flame, which he
proves thus:</p>

<p>A lighted Candle being set under a Bell, closely fix&#8217;d upon a Table, will
burn perhaps a Minute or two in Proportion to the Quantity of Air pent up
with the Candle in the Bell; but as soon as the Quality in that Air, which
is necessary to feed the Flame, is exhausted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> the Candle goes out; this
has been often try&#8217;d with the same Success; and we find, that by letting
into the Bell some fresh Air, a little before the Candle should have gone
out, it will still continue burning: And then to shew that this Quality in
the Air is the same which feeds the Life in Humane Bodies, it was try&#8217;d,
whether the Air, returning from the Lungs, would not have the same Effect
upon the Candle, as the External Air had before, but it had not, the
Candle went out at its usual Time: Thus, it seems, when we suck in Air for
Breath, the Lungs takes what is necessary for the Nourishment of our
Bodies, and returns back the rest.</p>

<p>After this we may naturally conclude, that where the Rooms, or Houses are
small, there ought to be frequent Admissions of the External Air, but
especially where those Rooms or Houses are too much crouded with People;
and if it is supposed that the External Air is Infectious, the burning of
<i>Aromaticks</i>, <i>Gums</i>, or <i>Herbs</i>, upon the letting in of fresh Air, is
necessary.</p>

<p>From the foregoing Observations we may learn, that all Pestilential
Distempers, whether in Animals or Plants, are occasion&#8217;d by poisonous
Insects convey&#8217;d from Place to Place by the Air, and that by uncleanly
Living and poor Diet, Humane and other Bodies are disposed to receive such
<i>Insects</i> into the Stomach and most noble Parts; while, on the other Hand,
such Bodies as are in full Strength, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> well guarded with
Aromaticks, would resist and drive them away, but chiefly how necessary it
is to allow the Body a Freedom of Air, and how to correct it if it is
Infected.</p>

<p>And I shall conclude with some Memorandums taken from the Papers of a
learned Gentleman, who in the time of the late Plague in <i>London</i> was
curious enough to make his Remarks upon the Signs of that Distemper, and
the Method of its Cure.</p>

<p>He tells, the Plague proceeds first from a corrupted and unwholsome Air.</p>

<p>The Second, is putrified Humours, hot Blood, caused by breathing in such
corrupt Air; and if the Diet before were perverse, it fills the Body with
superfluous Humours.</p>

<p>Concerning the common Fear of Infection, which makes many rich Men, which
might and ought to maintain poor visited People; and some Physicians
likewise, whose Duty it is to administer Physick to them, flee away, so
that in time of great Infection we hear more cry out for want of Bread and
necessary means, than for anguish of the Disease.</p>

<p>Hence also came that inhumane Custom of shutting up of Houses that are
visited with Pestilence, dejecting their Spirits, and consequently making
way for the Disease, and taking Men from their Labour, which is a digester
of Humours, and a preserver of Health; and if the Disease be Infectious
(as in their Opinion it is) it is plain Murder, to shut Men up in an
infected and destroying Air.</p>

<p>But all Mens Bodies are not full of Humours; if they were, all would be
infected.</p>

<p>After this I find the following Directions to prevent Infection. <i>First</i>,
To avoid the Fear of it, and support the Spirits in the next place.
<i>Secondly</i>, To keep the Body soluble, and to use the juice of <i>Lemons</i>
often. <i>Thirdly</i>, he recommends a Diet of quick Digestion, and to eat and
drink moderately:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> He prescribes likewise the Smell of Aromaticks, such as
<i>Camphire</i>, <i>Styrax</i>, <i>Calamites</i>, Wood of <i>Aloes</i>, &amp;c. and to be taken
inwardly, <i>Mithridate</i>, <i>Anjelica</i>, and <i>Petasetis</i>-Roots; and, in an
express Manner, he recommends Cleanliness, and the Choice of a clear Air.</p>

<p>After Infection he tells us the Signs are an extraordinary inward Heat, a
Difficulty of Breathing, a Pain and Heaviness in the Head, an Inclination
to Sleep, frequent Vomiting, immoderate Thirst, a Dryness on the Tongue
and Palate; but especially if we discover Risings or Swellings behind the
Ears, in the Groin, or other tender Parts of the Body; but this last,
where it happens, is of Advantage to the Patient; for he says, in such a
Case, the Plague is rarely Mortal, for then Nature has Power to dispel the
Venom, and drive it from the most noble Parts; and then he recommends
Bleeding; but if Spots appear upon the Body, he advises the Use of
<i>Emeticks</i>, and afterwards <i>Sudorificks</i>, which, by his Papers, we find he
gave with good Success, but he decries the Use of Opiates at the Beginning
of the Distemper.</p>

<p>He concludes with Directing of proper Cordials, to refresh and strengthen
the Patient, such as <i>Confect. Hyacint.</i>, <i>Confect. Alchermes</i>, <i>Pulv.
Gasconi&aelig;</i>, <i>Bezoar Orient.</i> and such like.</p>

<p>But my Worthy Friend, Sir <i>John Colebatch</i>, who has in other Cases
declared himself for Publick Good, has, in this, likewise been Careful to
provide against the Infection, and especially recommends to his Friends,
to collect large Parcels of the Ripe <i>Ivy Berries</i> which are known from
the others by their Blackness.</p>

<p>Thus have I given my Reader such a View of the <i>Plague</i> in general, as may
point out to him its natural Cause, Progress of Infection, and the Methods
that have been used by the Learned, to prevent the spreading that Terrible
Distemper.</p>
